# JavaScript Form Validation
A simple survey using JavaScript DOM practices for client side form validation.

## About
[This webpage](https://taylorbotts.github.io/js-form-validation-survey/) was an exercise in client side form validation using JavaScript and the DOM. On focus of each field, the script prompts the user to input a specified piece of information (ie: first name, last name, etc). On blur, the script checks the field value against a regular expression and displays a thumbs up or thumbs down whether it's valid or invalid.

The user then has two multiple choice questions to answer which, using some simple logic, will return a Game of Thrones character that matches their answers.

In this assignment, I was not allowed to use the innerHTML DOM property.
