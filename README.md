# JavaScript Form Validation
A simple survey using JavaScript DOM practices for client side form validation.

## About
This webpage was an exercise in client side form validation using JavaScript and the DOM. On focus of each field, the script prompts the user to input a specified piece of information (ie: first name, last name, etc). On blur, the script checks the field value against a regular expression and displays a thumbs up or thumbs down whether it's valid or invalid.
